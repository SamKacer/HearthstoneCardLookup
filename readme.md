# Hearthstone Card Lookup

This is an NVDA addon that lets users quickly lookup info for a specific Hearthstone card by its name.

- [download stable version](https://github.com/SamKacer/HearthstoneCardLookup/releases/download/v0.10.6/HearthstoneCardLookup-0.10.6.nvda-addon)

## Usage

Either select the text of a card name or have it copied to your clipboard, then press NVDA + H, which will try to find the card info and display it in a pop-up browseable window.

Alternatively, you can press NVDA + shift + H, which will bring up a dialogue where you can type in the name of a card to look up.

### Example output

```
Tirion Fordring
8 mana
6 6
Divine Shield. Taunt. Deathrattle: Equip a 5/3 Ashbringer.
Minion
Paladin
Legendary
Legacy
If you haven't heard the Tirion Fordring theme song, it's because it doesn't exist.
```
